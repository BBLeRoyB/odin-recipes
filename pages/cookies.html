        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 410 degrees.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together cold cubed butter, brown sugar, and sugar for 4 minutes or until creamy.</li>
            <li>Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each one.</li>
            <li>Stir in flours, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt. Mix until just combined to avoid overmixing. Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts.</li>
            <li>Separate dough into large balls and place on lightly colored cookie sheet. They are bigger than you think! You will fit 4 cookies on one large cookie sheet. The dough makes 8 extra large cookies.</li>
            <li>Bake for 9-12 minutes or until golden brown on the top. Let them rest for at least 10 minutes to set.</li>
